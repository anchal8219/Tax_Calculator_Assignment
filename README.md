# Tax Calculator
This tax calculation model has a simple structure: Individuals under 40 pay no tax if their income after deductions stays below 8 Lakhs. For those over 40 but under 60, any income exceeding 8 Lakhs is taxed at 40%, and for those 60 or older, the tax rate is 10%. For example, a 34-year-old earning 40 Lakhs with no deductions would owe 30% of the income exceeding 8 Lakhs, totaling 9.6 Lakhs in taxes.
